## History

Where did vibeOS Begin? It starts with a breif modern history. On July 10, 2020, Divide messaged me with a ZIP file containing one of the first
versions of what would become vibeOS Legacy. It was basic and buggy, with the only thing really working being able to move the windows around, but it showed promise. I was onboard and got to work... even though I had little to no JavaScript knowlage at that time.
